# Introduction to C Programming 2016

This repository is intended for group number 4 and is not essential for
completing this course. All files provided are simply here to support your
learning experience.

This stuff may not always be in line with the lecture, discretion is advised.

## What you should know by now

### Linux / Shell

Everything taught in the *Brückenkurs* (see references). The more you know
about the system you are using, the better. Getting the big picture as well as
its details is the key to understanding the interaction of components (kernel,
operating system, programs, shell, networks, ...).

### Technical Stuff

- What is the purpose of a compiler
- Typical stages of a compiler
- Calling `gcc` with additional flags

### Makefile

- Defining and using variables
- Defining and invoking rules
- Why `.PHONY` is needed
- What target is build by default
- How to build a specific target
- Dependencies (*prerequisites*) of a target
- Purpose of the targets `all` and `clean`
- Forcing a rebuild of a target by passing `-B`
- Predefined variables like `$(CC)` and `$(RM)`

### C Programming
